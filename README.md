#### Technologies Used
This app was built using Express, Mongoose, React, Node.js.

*React.js

*Express
Utilized express to handle requests from users, sava data to SoundDump's database, and process the data
Implemented HTTP methods using both Express and JavaScript

*Mongoose
Used mongoose to create schemas to make it easier to interact with MongoDB within SoundDump
Created post and user models to organize data

*Node.js

##3 Unsolved Problems / Future Directions

I would like to have the ability to search for a song directly in the "new post" page
I would like to make it easier for a user to post a song without the embedded link.
